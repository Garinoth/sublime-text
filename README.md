This is a selection of some packages I have used while I was developing with Sublime. Depending on the plugin, they are wonderful prettifiers, linters or superb tools that helps you coding, being more productive. There are so many, but these worked for me pretty good:

- Alignment
- Can I Use
- CoffeeCompile
- CoffeeScript
- CSSLint
- CSSComb
- Emmet
- Git
- HTML5
- HTML5 Attributes
- jQuery
- JS Minifier
- Stylus

- SublimeLinter
